Can you describe how you’ve used it?</h2> <p>I got started with Quora marketing a couple of years ago by accident. I happened to notice in my Google Analytics that I was getting a fair amount of traffic from Quora, and decided to investigate.</p> <p>It turns out that someone had asked a question on Quora about finding a good feedback gathering solution, and someone else replied with a list of potential products. One of those was Doorbell.</p> <p>Looking around at other similar questions, I saw that most of the replies were people posting about their own product in a very obvious and self-promoting way. However there’s the Answer Wiki at the top of all the answers, which was usually empty.</p> <p>Given that it would be far more useful for people to get a list of tools right below the question instead of long paragraphs of self-promotion, I decided to start aggregating all the answers into the Wiki. And if Doorbell was a valid answer to the question, I’d include it in the list.</p> <p>I found this to be a good mix of new exposure for Doorbell, while adding value to people visiting the Quora thread. Much better than adding yet another long self-promoting reply to an already long Quora thread!</p> <h2 id="how-do-you-think-about-competition">How do you think about competition?</h2> <p>I generally try and ignore the competition. It would be all too easy to get caught up comparing your product to the competition, and then you’re constantly just trying to play catch-up on the feature-set you offer.</p> <p>I instead try and focus on creating a good user experience for the users, while providing excellent support.</p> <p>Being a one-man team means I can’t compete on features with much bigger competitors. But I can definitely talk to my customers directly, and fix reported bugs in minutes instead of weeks. All of which provides a great experience for my customers.</p> <h2 id="whats-a-specific-lesson-youve-learned-from-running-doorbellio">What’s a specific lesson you’ve learned from running Doorbell.io?</h2> <p>Don’t underprice your product. Which may sound a bit like the “raise your prices” advice, but I see it a bit differently.</p> <p>When you’re starting your business, you might think that if the price is too high nobody will pay. But if the price is too low, how can I be confident as a customer that this is a sustainable business that won’t disappear on me overnight?</p> <p>If you start thinking of the business in terms of something that needs to support you, and how many customers you’d need in order to do that, it might change your perspective a bit on how to price your product! Especially in SaaS.</p> <p>That’s something that I’ve seen myself with Doorbell as it has grown and I have needed to pay for more services. If something seems too cheap, I’d worry that it isn’t a sustainable business and I might not be able to rely on it.</p> </article> <div class="mt4 red-links"> <p class="font--mono">Tags: <a class="capitalize" href="/tag/pricing">pricing</a>, <a class="capitalize" href="/tag/competition">competition</a>, <a class="capitalize" href="/tag/growth">growth</a>, <a class="capitalize" href="/tag/query">query</a>, </p> </div> <div> <a class="btn btn--outline" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20this%20interview%20from%20%40queryinterviews:%20urlofpage"><img class="relative button-icon" src="/img/twitter.svg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Twitter</a> </div> </div> </div><section class="container mt4"> <div class="is-revealing reveal-on-scroll border--full rounded p3"> <h4 class="mb1">Building something on the web?</h4> <p class="mb1 pb1">Get Query interviews delivered to your mailbox every Tuesday and learn a better way to do work and start a&nbsp;business.</p> <div id="mc_embed_signup" class="hide-on-mobile"> <form action="https://queryinterviews.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=a3f41956c3bc8e6bf0b723ccf&amp;id=139ad3afed" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" target="_blank" novalidate> <div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"> <div class="mc-field-group form-group clearfix"> <input type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="form-control inline-block float-left required email" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Your email address" style="max-width: 300px;"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="btn btn--default float-left" style="margin-left:-1px;flex-basis: 150px; max-width: 150px;"> </div> <div id="mce-responses" class="default-links mt1"> <div class="response text--primary-color" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div> <div class="response text--darkest-gray" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div> </div> <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_a3f41956c3bc8e6bf0b723ccf_139ad3afed" tabindex="-1" value=""></div> </div> </form> </div> <div id="mc_embed_signup" class="show-on-mobile"> <form action="https://queryinterviews.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=a3f41956c3bc8e6bf0b723ccf&amp;id=139ad3afed" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" target="_blank" novalidate> <div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"> <div class="mc-field-group"> <input type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="form-control required email" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Your email address"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="btn btn--default mt1 full-on-mobile"> </div> <div id="mce-responses" class="default-links mt1"> <div class="response text--primary-color" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div> <div class="response text--darkest-gray" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div> </div> <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_a3f41956c3bc8e6bf0b723ccf_139ad3afed" tabindex="-1" value=""></div> </div> </form> </div> </div> </section> <footer class="pt4 pb3 mt4 align--center"> <a class="link--gray_no-underline full-width-on-mobile m0-on-mobile p1" href="/interviews/">Interviews</a> <a class="link--gray_no-underline full-width-on-mobile m0-on-mobile p1 ml3" href="https://twitter.com/queryinterviews" target="_blank">Twitter</a> <a class="link--gray_no-underline full-width-on-mobile m0-on-mobile p1 ml3" href="/submit/">Submit</a> <a class="link--gray_no-underline full-width-on-mobile m0-on-mobile p1 ml3" href="/contact/">Contact</a> <a class="link--gray_no-underline full-width-on-mobile m0-on-mobile p1 ml3" href="/privacy-and-terms/">Privacy & Terms</a> </footer> <script src="https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal@4.0.0/dist/scrollreveal.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/main.js"></script> <script>window.ga=function(){ga.q.push(arguments)},ga.q=[],ga.l=+new Date,ga("create","UA-XXXXX-Y","auto"),ga("set","transport","beacon"),ga("send","pageview");</script> <script src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js" async></script> </body> </html>
